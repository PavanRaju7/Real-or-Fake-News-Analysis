1. Global Problem Solver:

Identified and addressed the longstanding issue of fake news, emphasizing its surge with the introduction of social media platforms. Recognized deliberate efforts to spread misinformation and propaganda, particularly through sites like Facebook, demonstrating a proactive approach to mitigating the global impact of false information.

2. NLP Project Leadership:

Led the Real or Fake News Analysis System project, focusing on the development of methods for detecting and classifying news stories using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Oversaw data gathering, preprocessing, and translation into supervised model features, showcasing leadership in a project aimed at combating fake news.

3. AI and ML Application:

Applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to automatically detect and prevent the spread of fake news. Successfully employed advanced algorithms, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost classifier, and RandomForest classifier, to develop a robust model for news classification.

4. Data Management Expert:

Managed the initial two datasets comprising real and fake news through merging, shuffling, and preprocessing. Achieved a final dataset of 44,685 rows and 4 columns, including Title, Text, Subject, and a binary indicator (TF) of real or fake news. Demonstrated proficiency in handling large datasets and ensuring data quality.

5. Model Training and Evaluation:

Trained the model using Logistic Regression, XGBoost classifier, and RandomForest classifier algorithms. Tested the efficiency of the classifier using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices, achieving a remarkable 99% accuracy on both training and testing datasets. Highlighted skills in model training and evaluation.

6. Deployment and UI Development:

Successfully deployed the final model locally and globally using Streamlit, showcasing proficiency in model deployment and user interface development. Demonstrated the ability to make complex models accessible through streamlined and user-friendly interfaces, enhancing the practical application of the developed system.
